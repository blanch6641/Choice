# Choice Properties — Permanent Platform Rules

> ### 🚀 DIRECTIVE — ADDRESS CHANGING & SYNTHETIC RELOCATION ENABLED (VERIFIED MUNICIPAL STREET PROTOCOL)
> **STATUS: FULLY ENABLED ACROSS ENTIRE PROJECT & PIPELINE (OWNER AUTHORIZED)**
> 
> 1. **Address Changing / Aliasing & Synthetic Relocation Enabled**:
>    - Address changing, same-block aliasing (+8 offset), and synthetic cross-city relocation are **ACTIVE AND FULLY ENABLED** across the pipeline, admin tools (`#pl-relocate-modal` & `#pl-bulk-relocate-modal`), `/api/relocate`, and publishing workflows.
>    - **Verified Municipal Street Mapping Protocol**: When relocating properties cross-city (e.g. from Dallas to Yukon, OK 73099), addresses must strictly use verified real residential streets and parcel ranges recognized by municipal and postal geocoders (e.g. `704 Oak Ave`, `820 Elm Ave`, `412 Holly Ave`, `624 Cedar Ave`, `408 S 8th St`, `3216 Vandament Ave`), paired with exact verified GPS coordinates. Synthetic or unverified street names are strictly prohibited. Original source identifiers remain preserved in pipeline metadata/legal address.
>    - **Multi-ZIP Geographic Distribution Rule**: When publishing or relocating to a designated target location/city (e.g. Yukon, OK), you must NOT publish all properties in the same single ZIP code. Distribute the properties across the different valid residential ZIP codes covering that municipality and its adjacent residential corridors (e.g. for Yukon: `73099`, `73127`, `73132`, `73064`), unless the user explicitly mandates a single specified ZIP code (e.g. "all in 73099").
> 
> 2. **Image Reordering Disabled — Strict Original Order**:
>    - Automated image reordering is **COMPLETELY DISABLED**.
>    - **All images must be ordered exactly as they came from the original source.**
>    - The first image from the original listing/feed must remain the primary hero cover photo (`display_order: 0` / `is_hero: true`).

**These rules are mandatory and apply to every scraper, publisher, and enrichment
step — current or future. They must never be bypassed without an explicit
administrator decision.**

## 1. Image Requirements (Highest Priority)

Every property **must** have source images present before it can be published.
Photos are transferred to ImageKit by `import-pipeline-photos` immediately
after publish — the pre-publish gate is that at least one source URL exists in
`original_image_urls`.

### Two-tier image rule

| Scenario | Gate |
|---|---|
| **First publish** (no `choice_property_id` yet) | `original_image_urls` must be a non-empty JSON array. ImageKit transfer runs automatically post-publish via `import-pipeline-photos`. |
| **Re-publish** (already has `choice_property_id`) | `property_photos` table must have ≥ 1 row for this property (photos already on ImageKit). |

This rule is enforced in three places — all must remain consistent:
1. **`pipeline_publish` PostgreSQL RPC** — checks `original_image_urls` server-side, blocks with a clear error
2. **`js/admin/pipeline.js` `validateForPublish()`** — client-side gate before the RPC call
3. **`scraper/enrichment.py` `validate_for_publish()`** — scraper-side gate

### Additional image standards
- Download every original image at the highest quality available from the source.
- Upload every image to the Choice Properties ImageKit account.
- **Never** store external/hotlinked image URLs as the final `property_photos.url`.
- If ImageKit is unavailable or any upload fails:
  - Keep the property in the pipeline with status `pending_images`.
  - Log the reason for the failure.
  - Retry when ImageKit becomes available.
- Preserve the original image order; use the first image as the featured image.

## 2. Description Enrichment

All the following rules run automatically via `apply_enrichment_pipeline()` in
`enrichment.py`. **Do not skip or bypass this pipeline.**

### 2a. Tour & Showing Language — REMOVE
Strip any phrasing that invites a visitor to schedule a tour or contact the
owner/agent, including but not limited to:

- "Schedule a tour / showing / viewing"
- "Book a tour / showing"
- "Request a viewing"
- "Tour today / now"
- "Open house"
- "Showing available"
- "Contact for viewing / showing"
- Equivalent rewordings detected by regex

### 2b. External Application Instructions — REMOVE
Remove any instruction that directs applicants to another platform:

- TurboTenant, Zillow, Apartments.com, Realtor.com, Homes.com, RentSpree, etc.
- "Copy Property ID", "Listing ID", "Property ID #XXXX"
- "Apply on [other site]"
- External application links or portal instructions

### 2c. Property Manager / Owner References — REMOVE / REPLACE
Remove personal agent/owner/management references. Replace public-facing
phrases with **Choice Properties** where appropriate:

- Property Manager, Leasing Office, Leasing Agent
- Contact Owner / Contact Landlord
- Management Company
- Call / Text / Email [agent name]

### 2d. Third-Party Branding — REMOVE
Strip brokerage names, MLS identifiers, and other platform branding from
descriptions.

### 2e. Security Deposit Mentions — REMOVE (Mandatory)
Listing descriptions must NEVER mention, quote, or state security deposit
amounts, clauses, terms, or conditions. All references (e.g. "Security deposit:
$1,500", "Deposit is equal to 1 month rent", "Refundable security deposit
required", etc.) must be completely stripped from listing descriptions by
`strip_security_deposit_from_description()` during enrichment. While the
database stores a structured `security_deposit` field (defaulting to 1× monthly
rent), listing descriptions must remain 100% free of deposit statements.

### 2f. Lease Terms & Duration — OMIT (Mandatory)
No property should show lease terms or minimum lease duration. Scrapers,
enrichment pipelines, and AI assistants must never extract, populate, or
display lease terms (`lease_terms`, `minimum_lease_months`). All listings must
omit lease term durations so no properties display them on the platform.

### 2g. Available Dates & Move-In — OMIT & STRIP (Mandatory)
No property should show available dates, move-in status, or "Available From" tables.
Scrapers, enrichment pipelines, and AI assistants must never extract or display
available dates. All available dates, "available now", "available on [date]",
"move-in ready", "move-in date", and availability claims must be completely stripped
from listing descriptions by `strip_availability_from_description()`. All property
details pages, overview cards, and listing cards must never display availability dates.

---

## 3. Application Fee Normalization (Mandatory)

**Choice Properties charges a flat $50 application fee. No listing may ever
state or imply a different amount.**

### 3a. Explicit fee amounts — normalize to $50
Any mention of an application fee amount other than $50 in the description must
be replaced with "Application Fee: $50."

Examples that must be caught and corrected:

| Original wording | Corrected output |
|---|---|
| `$35 application fee` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `Application fee is 45` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `Fee: $60` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `40 dollars application fee` | `Application Fee: $50.` |

### 3b. Free-application language — replace with $50 statement
Any wording indicating the application is free or costs $0 must be replaced with
"Application Fee: $50." This includes but is not limited to:

| Phrase (and similar wordings) | Corrected output |
|---|---|
| `Free application` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `Apply for free` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `No application fee` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `Zero application fee` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `$0 application fee` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `Complimentary application` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `Free to apply` | `Application Fee: $50.` |
| `No fee to apply` | `Application Fee: $50.` |

## 4. Rent Consistency & Description Sanitization

### 4a. Rent Consistency
Every mention of rent in the description must match the property's
published `monthly_rent` field. Conflicting amounts are replaced by
`enforce_price_consistency()` in the enrichment pipeline.

### 4b. Security Deposit Removal
Listing descriptions must never state or quote security deposit amounts.
Security deposits are managed strictly through structured database records
and must remain omitted from all description prose.

### 4c. Lease Terms Prohibited & Omitted
No properties show lease terms or minimum lease duration. Scrapers,
enrichment pipelines, and AI assistants must never extract, populate, or
display lease terms (`lease_terms`, `minimum_lease_months`). All listings
must omit lease terms.

---

## 5. Pre-Publish Validation Gate

Before any property transitions from the pipeline to a live listing, it must
pass `validate_for_publish()` in `enrichment.py`. The check verifies:

- [ ] Images successfully uploaded to ImageKit
- [ ] No "free application" language in description
- [ ] No application fee other than $50 referenced in description
- [ ] No tour/showing/contact CTA language
- [ ] No external portal application instructions
- [ ] `monthly_rent` is set

A property that fails any check **must not be published**. Log all failures.

---

## 6. Structured Field Enforcement

The `application_fee` database field must always be `50`. This is enforced by
`rule_based_enrich()` in the enrichment pipeline (step 5, application fee floor).

---

## 7. Inheriting These Rules

Every new scraper or import script added to the project must call
`apply_enrichment_pipeline()` from `scraper/enrichment.py` before inserting
records into the pipeline. This single call enforces all rules above
automatically.

```python
from enrichment import apply_enrichment_pipeline, validate_for_publish

records, watermarked_count = apply_enrichment_pipeline(records, verbose=True)

# Optional: gate individual records before publish
ok, failures = validate_for_publish(record)
if not ok:
    print("Publish blocked:", failures)
```

---

*Last updated: 2026-07-14*
*These rules are enforced in: `scraper/enrichment.py` → `apply_enrichment_pipeline()`*

### Photo Policy & Ingestion
- Visual screening and vision gating are removed from the pipeline because listings are pre-screened on the user's end before import.
- The 6-photo minimum gate is removed; listings with any photo count are published.
