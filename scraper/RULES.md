# Choice Properties — Enrichment Rules Quick Reference

> ### 🚀 DIRECTIVE — ADDRESS CHANGING & SYNTHETIC RELOCATION ENABLED (VERIFIED MUNICIPAL STREET PROTOCOL)
> **STATUS: FULLY ENABLED ACROSS ENTIRE PROJECT & PIPELINE (OWNER AUTHORIZED)**
> 
> 1. **Address Changing / Aliasing & Synthetic Relocation Enabled**:
>    - Address changing, same-block aliasing (+8 offset), and synthetic cross-city relocation are **ACTIVE AND FULLY ENABLED** across the pipeline, admin tools (`#pl-relocate-modal` & `#pl-bulk-relocate-modal`), `/api/relocate`, and publishing workflows.
>    - **Verified Municipal Street Mapping Protocol**: When relocating properties cross-city (e.g. from Dallas to Yukon, OK 73099), addresses must strictly use verified real residential streets and parcel ranges recognized by municipal and postal geocoders (e.g. `704 Oak Ave`, `820 Elm Ave`, `412 Holly Ave`, `624 Cedar Ave`, `408 S 8th St`, `3216 Vandament Ave`), paired with exact verified GPS coordinates. Synthetic or unverified street names are strictly prohibited. Original source identifiers remain preserved in pipeline metadata/legal address.
>    - **Multi-ZIP Geographic Distribution Rule**: When publishing or relocating to a designated target location/city (e.g. Yukon, OK), you must NOT publish all properties in the same single ZIP code. Distribute the properties across the different valid residential ZIP codes covering that municipality and its adjacent residential corridors (e.g. for Yukon: `73099`, `73127`, `73132`, `73064`), unless the user explicitly mandates a single specified ZIP code (e.g. "all in 73099").
> 
> 2. **Image Reordering Disabled — Strict Original Order**:
>    - Automated image reordering is **COMPLETELY DISABLED**.
>    - **All images must be ordered exactly as they came from the original source.**
>    - The first image from the original listing/feed must remain the primary hero cover photo (`display_order: 0` / `is_hero: true`).

> **For AI assistants:** These rules are enforced automatically by `enrichment.py`
> via `apply_enrichment_pipeline()`. You do NOT need to implement them — just call
> the pipeline correctly (see `PIPELINE_USAGE.md`). This file is here so you know
> what is and isn't allowed in a published listing.

## ✅ Things That Are ALWAYS Required

| Rule | What it looks like |
|---|---|
| Pets allowed = Yes | Every listing is published as pet-friendly |
| Security deposit = 1× rent (DB only) | `security_deposit` = `monthly_rent` in DB record; NEVER mentioned in descriptions |
| Application fee = $50 | `application_fee` field = 50, description says "Application Fee: $50." |
| Apply CTA at end of description | Ends with "Apply now through Choice Properties…" or similar |
| All photos on ImageKit | `property_photos.url` = `https://ik.imagekit.io/21rg7lvzo/…` |
| Photos in original order | First photo = hero / featured image |

## ✅ What the Pipeline Does Automatically (You Don't Need to Implement These)

When you call `PipelineOrchestrator.run(criteria)`, the pipeline automatically:

1. Drops competitor-branded listings (watermark check)
2. Strips tour/showing/contact language from descriptions
3. Strips external portal application instructions
4. Strips agent/owner/broker name references
5. Strips third-party brokerage/MLS branding
6. Strips corporate fee schedules and marketing blocks (Mynd "RENT WITH MYND" block, Invitation Homes fee blocks, Progress Residential, Tricon)
7. Strips all security deposit mentions and figures from descriptions
8. Strips all available dates, move-in status, and availability mentions from descriptions
9. Omits and clears all lease terms and available dates so no properties display lease duration or availability dates
10. Removes individual branded/agent photos from the image list
11. Normalizes HVAC fields from raw MLS blobs
12. Infers missing laundry, parking, pets, title, deposit from amenity tags (omits lease terms and available dates)
13. Enforces rent consistency between description text and `monthly_rent` field
14. Normalizes application fee to $50 in description text
15. Appends a "Apply now at Choice Properties" CTA to every description
16. Validates: photos ≥ 6, rent set, no banned language → blocks publish if any fail
17. Uploads all photos to ImageKit, verifies URLs, inserts into `property_photos`
18. Publishes, activates, and returns the live URL

## Scraping Source

- **Realtor.com via HomeHarvest** — works from Replit, no IP restriction
- **Zillow** — requires residential IP, does NOT work from Replit
- Always use `--source realtor` (the default) when running from Replit

## Credentials Location

All credentials are in `scraper/.env` — already committed, no setup needed.

## The One Command That Runs Everything

```bash
python3 scraper/<city>_batch.py --target 10 --past-days 90
```

All 16 rules above are enforced automatically. You only define the city, bedrooms, bathrooms, rent range, and property type.
