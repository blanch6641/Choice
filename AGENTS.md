# Choice Properties — AI Agent Rules & Directives

> ### 🚀 DIRECTIVE 1 — ADDRESS CHANGING, RELOCATION & VERIFIED MUNICIPAL STREET PROTOCOL
> **STATUS: FULLY ENABLED ACROSS ENTIRE PROJECT & PIPELINE (OWNER AUTHORIZED)**
> 
> 1. **Verified Municipal Street Mapping Protocol**:
>    - When relocating properties cross-city (e.g. to Yukon, OK or Charlotte, NC), addresses must strictly use verified real residential streets and parcel ranges recognized by municipal and postal geocoders, paired with exact US Census Bureau TIGER-line GPS coordinates.
>    - Synthetic or unverified street names are strictly prohibited. Original source identifiers remain preserved in pipeline metadata (`original_description`, `source_url`, `source_listing_id`).
> 2. **Multi-ZIP Geographic Distribution Rule**:
>    - When publishing or relocating to a target location/metro (e.g. Yukon / West OKC Metro), you must **NOT** publish all properties in the same single ZIP code.
>    - Distribute properties across the valid residential ZIP codes covering that municipality and its adjacent residential corridors (e.g. for Yukon: `73099`, `73127`, `73132`, `73064`), unless the user explicitly mandates a single specified ZIP code (e.g. "all in 73099").
> 3. **The Mandatory CLI Runner for Future AIs**:
>    - Future AI assistants MUST NOT write custom, unverified scraping code. Always execute the unified, Census-validated runner:
>      ```bash
>      node scripts/publish-relocated.mjs --source opendoor --count 5 --target "Yukon, OK"
>      ```
>    - The runner automatically handles Census TIGER geocoding, multi-ZIP distribution, original image sequence preservation, and Choice platform rule enforcement.

> ### 🚀 DIRECTIVE 2 — STRICT ORIGINAL IMAGE ORDER & DIRECT SOURCE CDN INGESTION
> 1. **Automated Photo Reordering Disabled**:
>    - Automated image reordering (such as shifting exterior photos deeper or promoting interior photos) is **COMPLETELY DISABLED**.
>    - All images must be ordered exactly as they came from the original source feed/listing.
>    - The first image from the source must remain the primary hero cover photo (`display_order: 1` / `is_hero: true`).
> 2. **Direct Source CDN Ingestion (No ImageKit Upload Latency)**:
>    - Ingest high-resolution source CDN photo URLs (Zillow CDN, Opendoor CDN, Realtor CDN) directly into `original_image_urls` and `property_photos`. Do not upload to ImageKit.
> 3. **No Photo Count Gate**:
>    - The 6-photo minimum gate is permanently removed. Properties with any photo count are published immediately.

## 1. Non-Negotiable Platform Invariants & Content Cleanup
Every property across the database, pipeline, and public site must adhere to these absolute rules:

- **Application Fee**: Always exactly $50. Structured DB field must be `application_fee: 50`. In listing descriptions, state strictly "$50 application fee" or "Application Fee: $50." Descriptions must NEVER state "$0 fee", "free application", or "fee is waived".
- **Pet Friendly**: Always 100% pet-friendly (`pets_allowed: true`). Dogs and cats welcome.
- **Security Deposit**: Always exactly 1x monthly rent in the structured DB field (`security_deposit: monthly_rent`), but **STRICTLY ZERO MENTIONS IN DESCRIPTIONS**. All deposit amounts, clauses, and quotes must be stripped from listing descriptions during enrichment (`strip_security_deposit_from_description`).
- **No Lease Term / Lease Duration Display**: Lease terms, lease lengths, and minimum lease duration are completely removed from all property details pages, overview cards, and descriptions (`lease_terms: null`, `minimum_lease_months: null`). Never display lease terms anywhere.
- **No Available Date / Move-In Display or Tables**: Available dates, availability tables ("Available From"), move-in dates, and move-in status are completely removed from all property pages, overview cards, sidebar tables, and descriptions (`strip_availability_from_description`). Never display available dates or move-in timelines.
- **No Smoking Policy**: Smoking policies and smoking tabs are removed from property details pages. Never display smoking policies on property pages.
- **Third-Party Sanitization**: Strip all broker contacts, agent phone numbers, MLS cross-links, portal URLs, external showing links, and tour/showing language. Replace management references with Choice Properties.

## 2. Property Precision & Architectural Classification Standards

### A. Bathroom Extraction & Decimal Precision (Zero Truncation)
- Fractional bathroom counts (`1.5`, `2.5`, `3.5`) must never be rounded down or truncated to integers.
- Scrapers and enrichment engines must deep-parse both structured fields and narrative text. If the source mentions a half-bath, powder room, or 2.5 baths, the database must strictly store `bathrooms: 2.5` and `half_bathrooms: 1`.

### B. Architectural Property Classification
Physical structural reality takes precedence over MLS portal defaults:
- **DUPLEX**: Any half-duplex, duplex unit, 1/2 duplex, or attached two-unit property.
- **TOWNHOUSE**: Any attached multi-story townhome or rowhouse.
- **SINGLE_FAMILY**: Standalone, detached single-family houses with independent parcel footprints.
- **APARTMENT**: Multi-family apartment complex units.

### C. Standardized Short Property Titles
- Titles in `properties.title` and `pipeline_properties.title` must strictly follow the clean address standard:
  `{Street Address}, {City}, {State} {Zip}` (e.g., `608 Maple Ave, Yukon, OK 73099`).
- Avoid marketing fluff or redundant spec prefixes in titles (specs are rendered in dedicated badges).

## 3. Deep Walkthrough Description Architecture
Descriptions must NEVER be brief 2-sentence summaries or generic AI fluff. They must read like comprehensive, high-end real estate walkthroughs that articulate everything included:

1. **Architecture & Property Setting**: Construction year, square footage, curb appeal, neighborhood context.
2. **Main Living & Interior Flow**: Living room scale, natural light, picture windows, flooring materials.
3. **Kitchen & Dining Details**: Cabinetry, countertops, pantry, and full appliance inventory (refrigerator, range/oven, dishwasher, microwave).
4. **Bedrooms & Bathrooms**: Primary owner's suite, closet capacity, secondary bedrooms, full & half bath fixtures (with exact decimal bath counts matching structured data).
5. **Utility, Comfort & Systems**: In-unit laundry hookups, high-efficiency central heating and air conditioning.
6. **Outdoor Living & Parking**: Yard space, private fencing, attached garage capacity or driveway parking.
7. **Inclusions & Choice Closing**: Pet-friendly confirmation, application fee strictly $50, and the closing invitation: *"Submit your rental application today at Choice Properties."*

### Contextual Relocation Scrubbing:
When an address is relocated, scrub all source artifacts:
- Strip local school districts (e.g. replace "Plano ISD" with "local top-rated school district").
- Strip specific highways/airports (e.g. replace "minutes from I-635 / DFW Airport" with "convenient access to regional commuter corridors and shopping").
- Strip source county and subdivision names.

### Anti-Cliché Rules:
Avoid repetitive AI marketing clichés (e.g., *“Welcome to…”*, *“Discover…”*, *“Nestled in…”*, *“Boasts…”*, *“Step inside…”*, *“Perfect blend…”*, *“Dream home…”*). Write with natural, varied sentence structure and realistic flow.

## 4. Post-Publishing Mandatory AI Response Formats

### Standard Public Listings Response Format:
After publishing properties to the live site, the AI assistant MUST output the published property link(s) in this exact sequential format:

1. 608 Maple Ave, Yukon, OK 73099 ($1,595/mo | 3 Bed / 2.5 Bath) — https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/property.html?id=f0470af2-573a-4b58-89d1-a1775ced83f1
2. 7400 Melrose Ln, Oklahoma City, OK 73127 ($1,750/mo | 4 Bed / 2.5 Bath) — https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/property.html?id=a443c7da-59c9-4d0c-919b-f5f56d502ede

**Template:**
`{n}. {Address}, {City}, {State} {Zip} (${Rent}/mo | {Beds} Bed / {Baths} Bath) — https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/property.html?id={property_id}`

### Client Multi-Property Magic Link Workflow (Section 3B):
When the user asks to create a **Client Multi-Property Magic Link** or publish listings so they **"do not appear on the public page"**:
1. **Private Placement Shield**: Store properties with `status: 'private_placement'` in `public.properties`. Because public browse queries strictly `status = 'active'`, private placement listings are completely hidden from public search, browse, and indexing.
2. **Generate Token & Share**: Create a 32-byte URL-safe base64 token, store its SHA-256 hash in `public.property_shares` (90-day expiry), and insert rows into `public.property_share_properties`.
3. **Single Master Magic Link Response**: Output **ONE SINGLE LINK** allowing the client to view all of those houses together:
   `https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/listings.html#share={token}`
4. **No Private Placement Badges**: Listings must look 100% standard to clients. Do NOT display "Private Placement" badges, banners, or labels anywhere on cards or detail pages.

---

## 5. Private Placement Architecture & Privacy Protocols
- **Anti-Google Lens Shield**: The gallery main image is covered by `.mosaic-touch-shield` with `-webkit-touch-callout: none !important;` to prevent mobile users from triggering "Search with Google Lens" or "Save Image". Subtle micro-filters disrupt automated image-hash match bots. Right-click context menus are disabled on galleries.
- **Soft Spec Rounding**: Square footage may be rounded to the nearest 25 or 50 sqft (e.g. `1,438` → `~1,450 sqft`) to eliminate exact mathematical fingerprint searches.
- **Unlisted Status Isolation**: Listings with `status: 'private_placement'` are only accessible via validated share tokens (`#share={token}`) or direct authorized admin sessions.

---

## 6. Mandatory Browser Extension Versioning & Sync Protocol
Any future AI agent modifying the Chrome Extension (`chrome-extension/`, `.pages-orion/`, `src/extractors/`, `supabase/functions/receive-pipeline-import/`) MUST adhere to:
1. **Never Make Silent Edits**: Whenever ANY file or extractor in the extension is modified, bump the semantic version (e.g., `v18.0.0` ➔ `v19.0.0`).
2. **Execute Automated Sync & Package Script**: You MUST run:
   ```bash
   node scripts/sync-and-bump-extension.mjs
   ```
   This compiles all extractor variants, updates `manifest.json`, `extension-meta.json`, `public/extension-updates.xml`, repackages `public/choice-properties-extension.zip`, and runs the automated extractor test suite (`20/20 test cases`).
3. **Documentation**: Record every version bump in `chrome-extension/README.md` and `docs/EXTENSION_CHANGELOG.md`.

---

## 7. Quality Audit & Automated Workflow
Every property follows this complete lifecycle:
**Scrape → Census Verify → Deduplicate → Enrich → Clean → Process Images → Synchronize Data → Generate Description → Validate → Auto-Correct → Publish**

- **Source of Truth**: Verified original listing details anchor facts; never invent room sizes, materials, or features.
- **Final Pre-Publishing Audit**: Verify $50 application fee, 1x deposit in DB / 0 in description, no lease terms, no available dates, strict original photo order, decimal bath accuracy, and verified Census GPS coordinates.
