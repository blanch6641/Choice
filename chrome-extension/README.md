## Features

- **Instant 0ms SPA Mount**: Detects client-side navigations and transitions immediately without lag.
- **Smart Pre-Flight HUD**:
  - Shows the detected photo count; listings are not blocked based on photo count.
  - Exact detected photo total shown for the current listing (no ambiguous `+N` remainder).
  - Mini photo thumbnail ribbon for instant visual preview.
  - Detected architectural structure tag (`DUPLEX`, `SINGLE_FAMILY`, etc.) for review.
  - Complete policy overview (Deposit 1x Rent, $50 App Fee, Pet Friendly).
- **Dual Ingestion & REST Fallback**: Dual-layer saving via Supabase Edge Function with seamless direct REST API fallback to eliminate any "unsupported source" or network interruptions.
- **Compact Folder Pill & Auto-Collapsing Popover**: Minimal 1-line folder pill above the Save button opens an on-demand popover to switch folders or create a new folder (with any name, including numbers, and optional description) directly on Zillow, auto-collapsing immediately once configured.
- **Sticky Default Folder Persistence**: Any folder created or selected automatically becomes the persistent default folder for all subsequent 1-click "Save to Pipeline" imports until changed.
- **Global Keyboard Shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Shift+S` (or `Ctrl+Shift+S`) to save immediately from anywhere on the page.
- **Resilient Auto-Retry Background Worker**: Automatically retries with exponential backoff on transient network drops to guarantee zero dropped listings.
- **Rule Compliance Enforced**:
  - **Rule 6A Zero Truncation**: Fractional baths (`1.5`, `2.5`, `3.5`) are never rounded down.
  - **Rule 6B Architectural Classification**: Side-by-side attached units and 1/2 duplexes are auto-classified as `DUPLEX`.
  - **Strict Stripping**: Never outputs lease duration or smoking policies.
- **Direct Edge Ingestion**: Sends data securely to the `receive-pipeline-import` Supabase Edge Function with auto deduplication.
- **SPA Listing Safety**: Re-reads the active listing before saving so replacing a property in the same tab cannot submit the previous property's data.
- **Source-Fact Accuracy**: Zillow estimates are not substituted for asking rent, and unavailable, lease-term, and smoking-policy fields are omitted from imports. Unknown feature facts stay unknown; generic cooling/window units do not imply central air, while explicit "No basement" wording is captured as false.
- **Location Intelligence Integration**: Property pages can load cached, server-side Geoapify nearby places and approximate neighborhood context. Details are documented in [`docs/LOCATION_ENRICHMENT.md`](../docs/LOCATION_ENRICHMENT.md); no school ratings, attendance boundaries, or walk/travel times are inferred.

## Development & Build Workflow

Whenever making modifications to the extension:
1. Edit the source extractor definitions in `src/extractors/shared-extractors.js` or `chrome-extension/content.js`.
2. Run the automated sync and bump tool:
   ```bash
   node scripts/sync-and-bump-extension.mjs
   ```
3. Verify test suite:
   - Compiles all 3 variants (`chrome-extension`, `.pages-orion`, `supabase/functions`).
   - Executes 20 automated test cases.
   - Bumps version and updates `extension-meta.json` and `public/choice-properties-extension.zip`.
4. Record all changes in `docs/EXTENSION_CHANGELOG.md`.
