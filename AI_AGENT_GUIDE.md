# AI Agent Guide — Choice Properties Pipeline

> ### 🚀 DIRECTIVE — UNIVERSAL RELOCATION, ZERO PHOTO GATE & STRICT CROSS-LOCATION SOURCING
> **STATUS: FULLY ENABLED ACROSS ENTIRE PROJECT & PIPELINE (OWNER AUTHORIZED)**
> 
> 1. **Universal Relocation & Census Verified Municipal Street Protocol**:
>    - Address changing and synthetic cross-city relocation are **ACTIVE AND FULLY ENABLED** across all 50 states and any municipality.
>    - Addresses must strictly use real residential streets and parcel ranges verified against the official **US Census Bureau TIGER-line geocoder**, paired with exact live rooftop coordinates. Synthetic or unverified street names are strictly prohibited.
>    - **STRICT Cross-Location Sourcing Rule**: NEVER scrape properties from the destination market/state itself. Always scrape from an external source state/city (e.g. TX, GA, CO, AZ, FL) when relocating to the target area (e.g. NC, OK) so that no local MLS reverse-lookups can collide.
>    - **Multi-ZIP Geographic Distribution Rule**: Distribute properties across valid residential ZIP codes covering the target municipality and adjacent corridors.
> 
> 2. **Zero Photo Count Gate (Permanent Removal of Photo Count Restrictions)**:
>    - The photo count gate is **PERMANENTLY REMOVED** across the entire project.
>    - Accept and publish listings with ANY number of authentic source photos (even 5, 4, etc.).
>    - Never skip or drop properties due to photo counts.
> 
> 3. **Image Reordering Disabled — Strict Original Order**:
>    - Automated image reordering is **COMPLETELY DISABLED**.
>    - All images must be ordered exactly as they came from the original source feed/listing.
>    - The first image from the source must remain the primary hero cover photo (`display_order: 1` / `is_hero: true`).
>    - Ingest high-resolution source CDN photo URLs directly. Do not upload to ImageKit.
> 
> **Read this first.** This file tells you everything you need to know to scrape,
> enrich, and publish rental listings to the Choice Properties website.
> No external AI services are needed — the entire pipeline runs locally.

## The One Command

All scraping and publishing goes through one universal runner:

```bash
python3 scraper/run_ai_job.py --instructions '<json>'
```

Or from a file:

```bash
python3 scraper/run_ai_job.py --instructions-file job.json
```

Or quick CLI mode:

```bash
python3 scraper/run_ai_job.py \
  --location "Dallas, TX" \
  --beds-exact 2 \
  --baths-min 1.0 \
  --rent-min 1300 \
  --rent-max 1800 \
  --rent-cap 1500 \
  --target 10
```

## Workflow for Any AI Agent

```
1. USER GIVES YOU INSTRUCTIONS
   Example: "Find 10 2-bedroom houses in Dallas, TX between $1300-1800"

2. YOU READ THE RULES
   - Read AGENTS.md (Section 5 — Permanent Engine Rules)
   - Read scraper/PLATFORM_RULES.md
   - Read scraper/RULES.md
   - Understand the mandatory requirements

3. YOU CONSTRUCT THE JOB
   - Translate user instructions into JSON criteria
   - Use run_ai_job.py --instructions '<json>'

4. YOU RUN THE PIPELINE
   - Execute: python3 scraper/run_ai_job.py --instructions '<json>'
   - The pipeline runs 13 steps automatically:
     1. Scrape Realtor.com (HomeHarvest + Phase 2 detail pages)
     2. Filter active/available + deduplicate
     3. Apply criteria filters + watermark detection
     4. Apply pricing rules
     5. Verify source photos (Zero photo count gate — any photo count accepted)
     6. Enrich (clean descriptions, normalize fees, add CTA, etc.)
     7. Pre-publish validation
     8. Stage in pipeline_properties
     9. Patch pricing + description
     10. Publish via RPC
     11. Activate property
     12. Ingest high-res CDN photos directly (no ImageKit upload delay)
     13. Return live URLs

5. YOU RETURN LIVE URLS
   - Parse stdout for "Published URLs:" section
   - Or use --json-output and parse the JSON
   - Return the URLs to the user so they can view live listings
```

---

## Hard Requirements (Never Bypass)

These are enforced automatically by the pipeline. You don't implement them — the system does. But you must know them:

| Rule | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **All photos on ImageKit** | No external/hotlinked photo URLs in final listings (user pre-screens listings; no 6-photo gate) |
| **Application fee = $50** | Both the `application_fee` field and description must say $50 |
| **Security deposit = 1x rent (DB only)** | `security_deposit` in the database equals `monthly_rent`; **NEVER** quote or mention deposits in descriptions |
| **No security deposit in descriptions** | All security deposit mentions, amounts, and clauses are completely stripped from listing descriptions during enrichment |
| **No lease terms / duration** | Lease terms are removed from enrichment documentation so no properties show that. Never extract, assign, or display `lease_terms` or `minimum_lease_months` |
| **Pets allowed = Yes** | Every listing is published as pet-friendly |
| **No competitor branding** | Listings from FirstKey, Invitation Homes, Progress Residential, Tricon, Coldwell Banker, Keller Williams, RE/MAX, Century 21, Berkshire Hathaway, Main Street Renewal, AMH, eXp Realty, etc. are dropped |
| **No tour/showing language** | "Schedule a tour", "Book a showing", "Open house", etc. is stripped |
| **No external portal refs** | TurboTenant, Zillow application, Apartments.com instructions are stripped |
| **No agent/owner names** | Personal contact references are stripped |
| **Apply CTA at end** | Every description ends with "Apply now at Choice Properties" |
| **Rent consistency** | Description rent figure must match published `monthly_rent` |
| **monthly_rent required** | Listing cannot be published without rent set |

---

## Watermark Avoidance

The system automatically protects against watermarked/branded content:

### Text/ Metadata Watermarks (Automatic)
The pipeline checks every listing's text fields for competitor brand names:
`is_watermarked()` in `scraper/enrichment.py` scans:
- `agent_name`, `broker_name`
- `description`, `showing_instructions`
- `original_data` JSON blob

Any match → **entire listing is dropped** before staging.

### Branded Photo Filtering (Automatic)
`filter_branded_photos()` removes individual photos that show:
- Competitor brand names in URLs (`firstkeyhomes`, `invitationhomes`, etc.)
- Agent/broker headshot paths (`/agent-photo`, `/headshot`, `/team-photo`, etc.)
- Known corporate CDNs (`agent.realtor.com`, `photos.cbkw.com`, etc.)
- URL path segments containing `/watermark` or `/logo.`

If ALL photos are branded, the listing is dropped entirely.
If only SOME are branded, the clean ones are kept.

### Strict Mode
Use `"strict_watermarks": true` in instructions to be more aggressive:
- Any listing with branded photos is rejected, even if clean photos remain
- Useful when you want zero branded content in your inventory

### Post-Upload Content Check (Future)
The `property_photos` table has a `watermark_status` column.
A future edge function can scan uploaded images for visible watermarks
using lightweight OCR or perceptual hashing.

## How to Get Live URLs Back

### Method 1: Parse stdout (default)

```
Published URLs:
  https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/rent/tx/dallas/2br-single-family-abc123/
  https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/rent/tx/dallas/2br-single-family-def456/
```

Extract all lines starting with `https://` under "Published URLs:".

### Method 2: JSON output (recommended for AI)

```bash
python3 scraper/run_ai_job.py --instructions '<json>' --json-output
```

Output:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "published_urls": [
    "https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/rent/tx/dallas/2br-single-family-abc123/",
    ...
  ],
  "stats": { "published": 10, ... },
  "errors": []
}
```

Parse `result["published_urls"]` — that's your deliverable.

## Error Handling

| Situation | What Happens | What You Should Do |
|---|---|---|
| Missing env vars | Fatal error, exit 1 | Tell user to set credentials in `.env` |
| Missing packages | Fatal error, exit 1 | Tell user to `pip install requests homeharvest` |
| No listings found | Error in output, exit 1 | Broaden criteria (wider rent range, more locations, more past_days) |
| All blocked by watermark | Listed in dropped count | Normal — try different locations or criteria |
| All fail validation | Listed in invalid count | Check photo counts, fix descriptions |
| Partial publish | Some URLs returned | Return what was published, note failures |

### When Things Go Wrong

1. **Zillow blocked** — Zillow blocks datacenter IPs. Use Realtor.com instead (`--source realtor` is default).
2. **Not enough photos** — Lower `rent_min`/`rent_max` or add more `locations`/`fallback_locations`.
3. **All watermarked** — The market may be dominated by corporate landlords. Try a different city.
4. **Validation failures** — Check that descriptions don't mention wrong fees, tours, or external portals.

---

## Quality Targeting

To get the best results:

1. **Set `min_score: 75` or higher** — only keeps listings with rich data
2. **Use `rent_floor`/`rent_cap`** — controls pricing without a custom function
3. **Provide `fallback_locations`** — if primary cities are thin, the pipeline automatically tries nearby areas
4. **Use ZIP codes** — `zip_codes: ["75201", "75202"]` gives 200 results per ZIP vs 200 for the whole city

---

## Source Sites

| Source | IP Restriction | Data Richness |
|---|---|---|
| **Realtor.com** (default) | None — works from anywhere | Phase 1: search data. Phase 2: up to 50 HD photos, full description, virtual tours |
| **Zillow** | Requires residential IP (mobile data, home WiFi) | Richer data but blocked from Replit/datacenters |

**Always use Realtor.com from Replit or CI.** Zillow only works from residential IPs (iSH on iPhone, home network).

---

## Credentials

All credentials are in `scraper/.env` (already configured):

```
SUPABASE_URL=https://tlfmwetmhthpyrytrcfo.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...
IMAGEKIT_PRIVATE_KEY=...
IMAGEKIT_URL_ENDPOINT=https://ik.imagekit.io/21rg7lvzo
```

Never commit or expose these. The runner reads them automatically.

```
USER: Find me 10 pet-friendly 2BR houses in Dallas, TX around $1500/month

AI (you):
  1. Read PLATFORM_RULES.md, RULES.md, PIPELINE_USAGE.md
  2. Construct JSON:
     {
       "locations": ["Dallas, TX"],
       "beds_exact": 2,
       "baths_min": 1.0,
       "rent_min": 1300,
       "rent_max": 1700,
       "rent_cap": 1500,
       "target": 10,
       "past_days": 90,

       "allowed_types": ["SINGLE_FAMILY", "TOWNHOMES"]
     }
  3. Run: python3 scraper/run_ai_job.py --instructions '<json>' --json-output
  4. Parse JSON output for published_urls
  5. Return to user:
     "Here are your 10 live listings:
      - https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/rent/tx/dallas/2br-single-family-abc123/
      - https://choice-properties-site.pages.dev/rent/tx/dallas/2br-single-family-def456/
      ..."
```

## Dynamic Description Architecture & Pre-Flight Compliance Linter

Every listing description generated in Choice Properties uses the modular fact-mining engine in `scripts/description-generator.mjs`:

### 1. Ground-Truth Fact Mining (`extractMinedFacts`)
- Extracts authentic textures, finishes (hardwood, LVP, tile, quartz), layout details (split bedrooms, walkout basements, tray ceilings), and itemized appliances directly from `original_description`.
- Eliminates hallucinations by grounding all claims in verified source text.

### 2. Dynamic Length Tiers (Zero Artificial Padding)
- **COMPACT (120–180 words, 1–2 paragraphs)**: For smaller layouts, duplexes, and 1–2 bedroom homes. Direct, punchy, and scannable.
- **STANDARD (220–300 words, 3 paragraphs)**: For typical 3–4 bedroom residences. Balanced neighborhood and room-by-room flow.
- **SHOWCASE (350–450+ words, 4–5 paragraphs)**: For large multi-tier residences with finished basements, expansive lot acreage, or luxury suite appointments.

### 3. Story Archetypes & Narrative Rotation
- `culinary_hub`: Prioritizes kitchen island, counter prep space, and entertaining connectivity.
- `multi_tier_retreat`: Prioritizes multi-level separation, finished lower-level suite, and flex work/media spaces.
- `single_level_ease`: Prioritizes accessible single-story ranch layouts, seamless gathering spaces, and fenced yard privacy.
- `townhome_sanctuary`: Prioritizes end-unit privacy, upper-level suite sanctuaries, and private patio living.
- `expansive_grounds`: Prioritizes acreage, outdoor decks, mature trees, and private recreation.

### 4. Pre-Flight Compliance Linter (`lintDescription`)
- **Zero Deposit Mentions**: Strictly confirms security deposits are 100% absent from text.
- **Zero Lease Terms**: Strictly confirms lease lengths/durations are omitted.
- **Zero Smoking / Move-In Dates**: Prohibits smoking policies and availability clauses.
- **Mandatory Statements**: Verifies exact `$50 application fee` and `Pet-Friendly (Dogs & Cats Welcome)`.
- **Decimal Precision**: Confirms description bathroom count decimal aligns with database record.

## Private Placement Architecture & Privacy Protocol

Every listing published to the platform adheres to the privacy protocol in `AGENTS.md` (Section 8) to prevent tenant lead leakage:

1. **Address Changing / Aliased Protocol [TEMPORARILY DISABLED]**: Address changing and block aliasing (+8 offset) are temporarily disabled across the project until further decision. The capability exists in the codebase but must not be used; authentic source addresses must be preserved.
2. **Photo Ordering [TEMPORARILY DISABLED]**: Automated photo reordering is disabled. All images must be ordered exactly as they came from the original source.
3. **Anti-Google Lens Shield**: Property galleries are protected by `.mosaic-touch-shield` with touch callout disabled and subtle image micro-filters to block mobile image searching and screenshot reverse-image AI.
4. **Soft Spec Rounding**: Square footage numbers are rounded to clean ~25 sqft increments.
5. **No Private Placement Badges**: Listings must appear completely standard and authentic to clients — all "Verified Private Placement" and "Private Placement" badges/banners are completely disabled and removed.
6. **Native Multi-Property Magic Sharing**: Multiple tailored homes are shared through the standard marketplace interface using `/listings.html#share={token}`. Share records store a hash of the random bearer token and an explicit property allowlist; tokens expire after 90 days and can be revoked. Raw `?p=` IDs do not authorize private listings. Anyone holding a share URL can use it, so the bearer link must be kept private.
